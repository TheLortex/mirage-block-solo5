This is a block driver wrapper for
[Solo5](https://github.com/djwillia/solo5) that is a hacked version of
[mirage-block-xen](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-xen) and
[mirage-block-unix](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-xen).  It
basically tries to get to C code to call the Solo5 virtio drivers as
quickly as possible.
